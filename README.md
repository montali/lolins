# Personal vCard website

This is an ultra simple vCard website I made as gift for a friend.
It was built using React (I wanted to use `react-awesome-button` because they really are awesome).
You can run it on your localhost by running:

```sh
$ yarn start
```

Feel free to use this project and contribute!
